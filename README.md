# SQL Project Portfolio - Rockbuster Data Insights
This repository contains SQL queries and data analysis for Rockbusterâ€™s strategic insights. The project focuses on customer segmentation, revenue analysis, and regional sales trends using SQL queries and PostgreSQL.

## Overview
This repository contains **SQL queries and data analysis** for Rockbusterâ€™s strategic insights. The project focuses on:
- Customer segmentation based on rental behavior 
- Revenue analysis by region and film categories 
- Identifying high-value customers 
- Optimizing film inventory management 

## Repository Structure

## SQL Techniques Used
âœ” **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** â€“ Used to improve query readability  
âœ” **Window Functions** â€“ Applied for ranking and segmentation  
âœ” **Joins & Subqueries** â€“ Used for retrieving complex data relationships  
âœ” **Aggregation Functions** â€“ Summarized revenue and customer activity  
âœ” **Indexes & Query Optimization** â€“ Enhanced database performance  

## Key Insights
ðŸ”¹ **Customer segmentation:** The top 20% of customers contribute to 60% of revenue.  
ðŸ”¹ **Geographic revenue patterns:** The highest revenue comes from Europe & North America.  
ðŸ”¹ **Inventory optimization:** High-demand movies need increased stock to reduce lost revenue.  

## Tools & Technologies
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ Database for executing queries  
- **Tableau** â€“ Used for data visualization  
- **GitHub** â€“ Version control & portfolio hosting  

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates the ability to analyze business data using SQL, extract insights from structured datasets, and optimize decision-making processes based on data.

This repository showcases SQL projects developed as part of my Data Analytics course (Achievement 3). The projects demonstrate various SQL techniques, including querying, data aggregation, joins, subqueries, and database optimization.
